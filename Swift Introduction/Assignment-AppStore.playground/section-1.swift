// Playground - noun: a place where people can play

import UIKit


/*ADVANCED Max 100% or A*/
//Create a Swift playground with a model that simulates how AppStore works.
/*
    Model should consists of three classes
    Developers
    Apps
    AppStore

    App store will have following rules:
        Developers have following properties and capabalities:
            they have unique id (Int)
            they can create apps
            they can transfer apps to other developer, which means that they can receive apps from other developers as well
            they can submit apps to the AppStore
            they own a bank account that is presented as profit (Double)

    Apps have following properties:
        developer (owner of the application)
        name (name of the app)
        price (price of the app)

    AppStore have following properties
        apps (collection ofthe apps submitted and approved to the app store)
        profit variable that stores profit of the store
        submission process (developers can submit apps to the store but they are not always accepted. Use an arc4random_uniform function to randomize the submission process

        every day customers buy apps from the App Store. Use an arc4random_uniform function to choose randomly which apps will be sold on the store and how many apps are sold. When the apps are sold app store receives 30% of the revenue and 70 percent of the revenue goes to the developer.


        every day it will computes number of sold copies and send information to developer

        when developer submits the app to the store, and submission is successful AppStore should update its app listings represented as array of apps

    
    Scoring:
    
    Valid structure of classes (50%)
    Submission process (10%)
    Randomized process of selling apps(10%)
    Transferring apps between developers (10%)
    Testing behavior of the store (20%)
